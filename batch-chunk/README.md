# Spring Batch Chunk Processing Sample

This module demonstrates how to implement chunk-based processing in Spring Batch using Kotlin.

## Overview

Spring Batch chunk processing divides data into chunks and processes them in a read-process-write pattern:
1. **Reader**: Reads items from a data source
2. **Processor**: Transforms or filters the items (optional)
3. **Writer**: Writes the processed items to a destination

This approach is ideal for processing large volumes of data efficiently.

## Prerequisites

- JDK 17 or higher
- Gradle 8.0 or higher

## Key Components

This module is set up as a template for implementing chunk-based batch processing with:
- Spring Boot 3.3.12
- Spring Batch
- H2 Database for job repository
- JPA support

## Building and Running

To build the project:
```bash
./gradlew build
```

To run the application:
```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

## Implementation Notes

This module provides a basic structure for implementing chunk-based batch processing. To implement your own chunk processing:

1. Create a reader to read items from your data source
2. Optionally create a processor to transform or filter items
3. Create a writer to write processed items to your destination
4. Configure a job with steps using your reader, processor, and writer
